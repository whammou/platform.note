** DONE Github repo updates track :GITHUB:
CLOSED: [2025-09-06 Sat 20:09]
- *OBJECTIVE:* Find a way to keep track github repo updates and get notification from updates
-----
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-09-06 20:08]: \\

-----
** ABORTED Github wiki :GITHUB:
CLOSED: [2025-09-06 Sat 20:09]
- *OBJECTIVE:* learn to write a github wiki page
-----
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-09-06 20:09]: \\
  Wiki is not needed for a =pkm= system as wiki is the way to take notes within a functional repo. That is essentially a =pkm= repo
-----
** PENDING Update github profile :GITHUB:

** ABORTED Workaround id link :GITHUB:ORGMODE:
CLOSED: [2025-09-06 Sat 21:03] DEADLINE: <2025-09-06 Sat>
- *OBJECTIVE:* Workaround github render does not support for id link like in orgmode
-----
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-09-06 21:03]: \\
  There are hardly and workaround with =id-link= that actually work because github is not meant to be a =pkm= hosting site. However one can always manually add file-link to their documents

*** PARTIAL Using file_link on Github

- *OBJECTIVE:* Adding aditional file_link in orgmode for interation on Github
-----
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-09-05 23:42]: \\
  + *Idea:* Using snippets to poplate an extra link for rendering on github
    * E.g. [[id:143eaa14-d3e0-4743-b745-07358c59476d][Using file_link on Github @Org]] ([[/system/platform/tasks/oneoff.org][view on Github]])
  + *Issue:* To generate a =file_link= to a percise location requires s /slug format/ of a =headline= AND its =state= which is not a suitable solution as =state= change dynamically compares to a static nature of a =headline=
    * Workaround - Disable render of =state= on github combines with =headline-slug= to genrate html friendly link
    * This works very fine with =docs= but not =tasks=
